### Hi there 👋 My name is Alexey Sinitskikh and I'm a Game Developer!
I like game development and I am very pleased to see the result of my work. For 10+ years of work, I have participated in the creation of games of various genres and scales - from social and mobile Casual games to AAA giants. I used different languages and technologies in my work.
